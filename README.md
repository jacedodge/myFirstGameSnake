# myFirstGameSnake
Mod 1 Project - Simple snake game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

This project was a ton of fun. I loved getting started with game functions and learning how to break a process into individual pieces. One of my favorite tech pieces I worked with, Import/Export in JS, really helped me through that process and helped me keep things clean and organized. Some of the functions were a little over my head but working with the grid function and other tech was simple enough.
