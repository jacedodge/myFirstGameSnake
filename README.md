# Snake
​
This was my first game built using JS, CSS, and HTML. It is a browser based copy of the game snake in which you collect the food pellets to grow larger and increase your score.
Touching the walls or yourself will result in game over. 
​
## Getting Started
​
Opening the html file and deploying a live server will load the game. To begin the game, touch any arrow key to move the snake.
